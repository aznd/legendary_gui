TODO :

add option to change runner (for every game?)

stop the user from clicking the db button more than once (maybe completely change this ; button dissapers after the table is created)

add list with games thumbnails

implement frames for hopefully better widget managment

check all user inputs if they are right

add indicator that a game is running

add proper way to check if user is logged in
