## legendary_gui
A GUI for legendary written in python

### How to run:
Just run the main.py file

### Currently you can:

Log in with your Epic Games Account

See all your games in a list

See all your installed games in a list

Change the runner for a specific game

Launch a game

Import an already downloaded game

More is coming!

### TODO: 
- [ ] Clean up a lot more, since this was one of my first projects

- [ ] If a game doesnt has a specific runner selected, it will not launch. so, check if a game has a specific runner selected, if not, use the globalrunner

- [ ] Stop the user from clicking the db button more than once (maybe completely change this ; button dissapers after the table is created)

- [ ] Add list with games thumbnails

- [ ] Check all user inputs if they are right

- [ ] Add indicator that a game is running

- [X] Add proper way to check if user is logged in

- [X] Implement frames for hopefully better widget managment

- [X] Add option to change runner for every game
