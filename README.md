### TODO: 
[ ] if a game doesnt has a specific runner selected, it will not launch. so, check if a game has a specific runner selected, if not, use the globalrunner

[ ] Stop the user from clicking the db button more than once (maybe completely change this ; button dissapers after the table is created)

[ ] Add list with games thumbnails

[ ] Check all user inputs if they are right

[ ] Add indicator that a game is running

[ ] Add proper way to check if user is logged in (DONE!)

[ ] Implement frames for hopefully better widget managment (DONE!)

[ ] Add option to change runner for every game (DONE!)
